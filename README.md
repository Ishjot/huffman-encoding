# huffman-encoding

### Huffman encoding with heaps.

A programming assignment by Ishjot Walia and Weikun (James) Zhang at UCSB.

This program will compress a text file using Huffman Encoding, and decode the compressed data back into the original message.

*This repository contains two examples, plain.input and encoded.input*


Usage:

<code>
make

./prog2
</code>

This will print the compressed verison of the text in plain.input and the uncompressed version of the text in encoded.input
