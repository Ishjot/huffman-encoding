# huffman-encoding

A programming assignment by Ishjot Walia and Weikun (James) Zhang at UCSB.

Huffman encoding with heaps.

This program will compress a text file using Huffman Encoding, and decode the compressed data back into the original message.

*This repository contains two examples, plain.input and encoded.input*


Usage:
1. make
2. ./prog2

This will print the compressed verison of the text in plain.input and the uncompressed version of the text in encoded.input
